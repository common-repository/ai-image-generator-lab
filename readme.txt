### No more stock photos!

AI Image Lab harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence to allow you to [create custom images for your site with AI](https://wpzone.co/blog/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-generate-custom-images-for-your-divi-and-wordpress-sites/) in supported editors and page builders and the WordPress media library. It also includes an image editor that can modify images by using AI-based technology to add or change elements in the image, both for images that were previously AI generated and for non-AI photos and graphics that you upload to your media library. This plugin brings the power of similar tools like **Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 2, and Midjourney** and integrates seamlessly with your WordPress websites. For more on **editing existing images with AI**, see [this blog post](https://wpzone.co/blog/how-to-improve-your-ai-generated-images-and-edit-photos-with-ai/).

The AI Image Lab plugin works with nearly every editor and page builder (like Divi, Elementor)  that integrates with the default WordPress media picker for image selection, including the **block editor (Gutenberg, Kadence Blocks, etc.), the classic editor, and [the Divi builder](https://wpzone.co/blog/generate-photos-and-artwork-in-the-divi-builder-with-our-free-ai/)**. It also includes a **Gutenberg block** for seamless image generation within the WordPress block editor that can transform to various core blocks and Kadence Blocks after a generated image is selected.

### 100% free

Our baseline service is **100% free to use, with unlimited image previews (within reasonable limits!) and up to 3 downloaded images per day, no paid third-party API keys required!** Once your download quota is used up, you'll need to wait until the current 24 hour quota period has passed before you can generate more previews. [Upgrading to AI Image Lab Pro](https://wpzone.co/product/ai-image-generator-lab/) removes the 3 image download limit, supports higher output resolution, and more!

The plugin needs to be connected to a WP Zone account before it can start sending requests to the AI. Signing up for an account is free if you don't have one yet!

### How it works

AI Image Lab generates custom graphics based on text you enter to describe the images you are looking for (known as a "prompt"). You can provide one or more prompt phrases (or choose from some provided examples), which **play an important role in the quality and usefulness of the output image**. You can also specify some additional parameters related to the style and specifications of the image you want to create. Style types include Photo, Painting, Illustration, and Digital Art, each of which has multiple sub-options to further refine the type of image to be generated.

Each time you run a prompt, you'll get six images to preview and choose from (or 10 images if you have [AI Image Lab Pro](https://wpzone.co/product/ai-image-generator-lab/). In the free version, these previews have watermarks, but **the visible watermarks are removed when you choose an image to download to your site**. The plugin allows you to select an image to automatically add to your media library for use on your site. Running the generation process again provides a new set of preview images.


### Known issues and limitations

AI image generation is still an emerging technology and **it is not perfect**. There are some things it struggles with, such as human faces and features (especially for images with multiple people) and images containing text. You can generate multiple sets of images until you receive a suitable image, or use the built-in AI image editor to improve generated images.

### Important Notice

The AI Image Lab plugin makes requests to using the AI Image Lab API, which is an external service provided by WP Zone (https://wpzone.co). You will need to set up a free account with WP Zone in order to use the service. Use of the service is subject to the terms and conditions displayed on the plugin admin page, and any other applicable terms and policies that may be published on the WP Zone website from time to time.

== Installation ==

1. Click "Plugins" > "Add New" in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Search for "AI Image Lab".
3. Click "Install Now".
4. Click "Activate Plugin".

Alternatively, you can manually upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, click The AI Image Lab item in your WordPress admin menu and follow the prompts to connect the plugin to your WP Zone account. Once connected, either visit the Media Library and click the Add New button, or select the option to upload in image in your content editor of choice. In both cases, you should have the option to use AI Image Lab to generate an image in the image upload area (provided the default WordPress media selection dialog is in use).
